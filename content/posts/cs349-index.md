This is the index page for a quick guide to programming languages, based on CS349 - Principles of Programming Languages.

This is intended as both a revision aid and as an introduction to some interesting topics introduced in the module.

This guide is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/efbicief/hugo-efbicief/blob/main/LICENSE), so you can do pretty much whatever you want with it, as long as any modifications or redistributions include the linked notice. I would also appreciate it if you were to credit me ðŸ«
