MentorMe is a platform that connects new employees with experienced mentors at their company. It was developed as a group project for CS261 - Software Engineering, and it consists of a backend API built with express.js, a web frontend built with react.js, and a database powered by Postgres.

As part of the development team, I was responsible for the matching algorithm that connects users and mentors in the backend, as well as integrating the frontend elements with the backend API. This project allowed me to work with various components of a full-stack web application and understand how they fit together to create a functional whole.
