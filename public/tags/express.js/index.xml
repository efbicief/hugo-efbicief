      <description>MentorMe is a platform that connects new employees with experienced mentors at their company. It was developed as a group project for CS261 - Software Engineering, and it consists of a backend API built with express.js, a web frontend built with react.js, and a database powered by Postgres.
As part of the development team, I was responsible for the matching algorithm that connects users and mentors in the backend, as well as integrating the frontend elements with the backend API.</description>
