<p><em>aka Fetch-decode-execute cycle</em></p>
<ul>

<li>We don&rsquo;t always need to wait for an instruction to finish completely before fetching the next.</li>

<h1 id="control-unit-design">Control unit design</h1>
<p>2 types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardwired CU: is a combinatorial &lsquo;random logic&rsquo; circuit. Quickly transforms inputs to needed output signals, but is complex, inflexible, and requires a long design time.</li>
<li>Microprogrammed: Uses a microprogrammed memory, which stores correspondances between inputs and outputs. Has it&rsquo;s own PC, IR, and micro memory addresses (aww! cute). Slower, but is easy to design and implement, and can be reprogrammed in case of a vulnerability being found.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="microprogrammed-control">Microprogrammed control</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each machine instruction is encoded as a sequence of microinstructions.</li>
<li>Writable control store allows for microcode changes and emulation of different processors.</li>
<li>Horizontal / direct control (unpacked): very wide microinstruction length, few microinstructions per machine instruction, fewer instructions therefore higher speed.</li>
<li>Vertical control (Packed / encoded field): Narrow width, n control signals stored in log_2(n) bits, limited parallelism, but less complex circuitry.</li>
<li>In reality a compromise is found between them; control signals get divided into groups
<figure><img src="/microinstructions.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Microinstruction length vs number per machine instruction</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="processor-performace-measures">Processor performace measures</h1>
<ul>
<li>Instruction bandwidth in MIPS: Millions of Instructions Per Second</li>
<li>Speedup = execution time on sequential machine/execution time on parallel machine</li>
<li>Processor utilisation = speedup with n cores/n cores</li>
<li>Data bandwidth in MFLOPS</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pipelining">Pipelining</h1>
<ul>
<li>Using interleaved memory can ease memory contention in pipelining.</li>
<li>2 types of pipelining:
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous: Uses handshake signals. Each stage signals when ready, and next stage signals back when ready to receive information.</li>
<li>Synchronous: One timing signal, determined by slowest stage. All data moves at once. Has registers between stages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pipeline-hazards">Pipeline hazards</h2>
<ul>
<li>Structural (resource conflicts): eg. 2 stages need to fetch from memory at the same time.
<ul>
<li>Solution: Use interleaved memory, fetch data together where possible giving more free memory time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Control (procedural dependencies): Conditional branches stop us from prefetching instructions, since we don&rsquo;t know what the next instruction will be. Solutions:
<ul>
<li>Instruction pre-fetch buffers: Fetch both possible outcomes of the branch, select once path is known.</li>
<li>Pipeline freeze: Don&rsquo;t admit any more instructions to the pipeline until branch resolved.</li>
<li>Static prediction: Predict always either branch taken or not taken (decision hard wired)</li>
<li>Dynamic prediction: On the fly prediction.
<ul>
<li>Branch instruction characteristics: Branch instruction indicates most likely way for the branch to go.</li>
<li>Target address characteristics: Short / backward branches more likely to be taken, since they are characteristic of loops.</li>
<li>Branch history: bits set or reset on outcome of execution are a good indicator of branch direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data hazards: When one (faster) stage uses information modified by a (slower) stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also pipeline execution units eg. adders to increase throughput.</p>
<h1 id="reservation-tables-and-collision-vectors">Reservation tables and collision vectors</h1>
<ul>
<li>Initial collision vector derived from diagram.</li>
<li>Count the distances between each pair in a row, and set the nth bit in the vector if there is a pair of that distance.
<figure><img src="/spacetime.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>The initial collision vector here is 110011 (order 543210). 0 is always set.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Using this, we can create a state diagram, and reduce it to it&rsquo;s simple cycles.
<figure><img src="/state.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>State diagram</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img src="/state2.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Simple state diagram</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Greedy strategy: always taking initiations when C0 = 0.</li>
<li>Average latency for a greedy cycle ≤ No. of 1s in initial collision vector.</li>
<li>Minimum average latency ≥ Max. no of Xs in reservation table row.</li>
<li>Average latency = average of simple cycle lengths</li>
<li>We add delays to the reservation table based on maximum number of parallel processes allowed (defined by minimum average latency)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not too sure how this works lol - Felix</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="superpipelining">Superpipelining</h1>
<ul>
<li>Some pipeline stages need less than half a clock cycle to execute</li>
<li>We can douple the clock speed for them, getting double the throughput; this is superpiplining.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="superscalar">Superscalar</h1>
<ul>
<li>Superscalar is fetching and decoding <em>more than one</em> instruction per cycle. This is achieved by having many functional units.</li>
<li>σ = degree of superscalar. Avg. number of instructions issued cannot exceed σ.</li>
<li>Uniform superscalar: Duplicate whole base pipeline.</li>
<li>Non-uniform: Different amounts of different functional units.</li>
<li>Superscalar allows for parallel fetch and decode operations.</li>
<li>Speedup of superscalar processors is limited by instruction level parallelism.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/superpipeline.png" height="400"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Superpipelining vs Superscalar</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="superscalar-execution">Superscalar execution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Program to be executed consists of linear sequence of instructions</li>
<li>Instruction fetch stage forms a dynamic stream of instructions, which are then dispatched into the window of execution</li>
<li>Processor executes them according to data dependencies and hardware availability.</li>
<li>Finally, results of instructions are put back into order. Speculative branches are removed if the sequential model determines they should not have occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="instruction-level-parallelism">Instruction level parallelism</h1>
<h2 id="out-of-order-execution">Out of order execution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Significant types of instruction order: Fetch order, execution order, order of updating memory locations.
3 main policies:</li>
<li>In order issue, in order completion: wouldn&rsquo;t be considered for a modern system. Instructions issued in the same order as they are executed.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/ii.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>In order issue, in order completion.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>In order issue, out of order completion: Any number of instructions can be in execution stage at once, but issue still stalled by resource conflicts, true data dependency and procedural dependency. Decodes up to a point of conflict.</li>
<li>Introduces output dependency: Instrustion B must wait for the result of Instruction 1 to start execution.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/io.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>In order issue, out of order completion.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Out of order issue, out of order completion: instruction window holds instructions after decoding, allowing processor to continue decoding during a conflict.</li>
<li>Lets conflicting instructions begin execution, as long as they don&rsquo;t finish before instructions effected by the conflict have started (i.e. fetched operands).</li>
<li>Introduces antidependency: Instruction B, which modifies variable V, cannot complete before Instruction A fetches the old value of V.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/oo.png" height="200"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Out of order issue, out of order completion.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="register-renaming">Register renaming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Output dependency and antidependency can be treated like a resource conflict.</li>
<li>We can solve this by duplicating the resource i.e. register renaming.</li>
<li>Subsequent instructions accessing the duplicated register are changed to refer to the duplicate.</li>
</ul>
